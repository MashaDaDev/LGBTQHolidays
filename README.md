LGBTQ Community Calendar

LGBTQ Community Calendar

There are a number of days and months observed, celebrated, and honored by my LGBTQ community. While the list below is specific to LGBTQ-focused days, weeks, and months, LGBTQ people also observe and celebrate non-LGBTQ specific moments such as Black History Month, Latine Heritage Month, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Women’s History Month, and Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Media coverage of these and other non-LGBTQ focused moments should include LGBTQ people and the intersections of LGBTQ people and the respective topic.
